            Here I will introduce my research field. My research focus on four aspects.
            Machine learning is programming computers to optimize a performance criterion 
            using example data or past experience . We have a model defined up to some 
            parameters, and learning is the execution of a computer program to optimize 
            the parameters of the model using the training data or past experience. 
            The model may be predictive to make predictions in the future, or 
            descriptive to gain knowledge from data.Machine learning 
            implementations are classified into four major categories, 
            depending on the nature of the learning “signal” or “response” 
            available to a learning system which are as follows:

        <p class = "introduction">
            Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence that 
            involves the development of algorithms and statistical models that 
            enable computers to improve their performance in tasks through experience. 
            These algorithms and models are designed to learn from data 
            and make predictions or decisions without explicit instructions. 
            There are several types of machine learning, including supervised 
            learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. 
            Supervised learning involves training a model on labeled data, 
            while unsupervised learning involves training a model on unlabeled data. 
            Reinforcement learning involves

            Machine Learning comes into the picture when problems cannot be 
            solved using typical approaches.  ML algorithms combined with new 
            computing technologies promote scalability and improve efficiency.  
            Modern ML models can be used to make predictions ranging from 
            outbreaks of disease to the rise and fall of stocks.
            Support vector machine is a supervised learning system and is 
            used for classification and regression problems. Support 
            vector machine is extremely favored by many as it produces 
            notable correctness with less computation power. It is mostly used 
            in classification problems. We have three types of learning supervised,
            unsupervised, and reinforcement learning. A support vector 
            machine is a selective classifier formally defined by dividing 
            the hyperplane. Given labeled training data the algorithm outputs 
            best hyperplane which classified new examples. In two-dimensional 
            space, this hyperplane is a line splitting a plane into two parts 
            where each class lies on either side. The intention of the support 
            vector machine algorithm is to find a hyperplane in an N-dimensional
            space that separately classifies the data points.
